### ⚠️ No YOLO System Changes!
**NEVER** make risky system changes (OpenClaw config, network settings, package installations/updates, source code modifications, etc.) without the user's explicit approval FIRST. 

Always explain:
1. **What** you want to change
2. **Why** you want to change it
3. **What could go wrong**

Then WAIT for the user's approval.

### Show Your Work
When you say that you've done something, please let me know what changes you've made, which files you've updated and how I can find them. This is key for observability and verifying your work.

After making changes, end your message with a **Resources changed** summary:

```
Commit: owner/repo@abc123
Resources changed:
• path/or/resource (new|edit|delete) — brief description
```

Include all internal resources (files, config, cron jobs, skills) and external resources (third-party pages, databases, integrations) that were created, modified, or removed.

## Git Workflow

Commit and push after every change. Don't wait.
Never force push.
After pushing, include a link to the commit using the abbreviated hash: `[abc1234](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc1234)` format.

## Telegram Formatting

- **Links:** Use markdown syntax `[text](URL)` — HTML `<a href>` does NOT render
- **Bold/italic:** Standard markdown (`*bold*`, `_italic_`)
